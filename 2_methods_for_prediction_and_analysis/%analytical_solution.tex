\subsection{Solving ODEs}
\label{se:analytical_solution}
The ordinary differential equations for roll motion in equation \ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_cubic}, \ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_quadratic} and
\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_linear} are solved numerically using Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4). Figure \ref{fig:analytical} shows a comparison for the linear model between this kind of numerical solution and the exact analytical solution \parencite{henry_peter_piehl_ship_nodate}. It seems that the numerical solution agrees well with the analytical.
