The hydrodynamic governing equation to describe a ship's six degrees of motions when sailing in waters is also written as a damped spring mass equations. In order to limit the scope of the study focusing on the roll damping, the second-order differential equation can be used to model the physical principles of a ship's roll motion response at sea. Then, the roll moment along a longitudinal axis though the centre of gravity can be expressed by,

where $A_{44}$ is the virtual mass moment of inertia, $B_{44}$ is the roll damping moment and $C_{44}$ is the restoring moment. $M_{44}$ represents the external moment (usually moment from external waves), and is of primary interest in this study. For small roll angles, the restoring moments $C_{44}(\phi)$ can be linearized to $C_{1}\phi$. To model the nonlinear restoring moments, $C_{44}(\phi)$ can be described by a n-th order polynomials as $C_{44}(\phi) = C_{1}\phi + C_{2}\phi^2 + C_{3}\phi^3 +, ..., C_{n}\phi^n $

Different experimental test methods are available to obtain the motion signals that can be used to determine the coefficients in Eq.(\ref{eq:roll_equation_himeno}). In this paper, the model scale roll decay tests are used. Since there are no external forces in such tests, the external moment in Eq.(\ref{eq:roll_equation_himeno}) is zero and the governing equation of the tests becomes,

where $B_{44}$ can be expressed as expansion series:  
$ B_{44} = B_1\cdot\dot{\phi} + B_2\cdot\dot{\phi}\left|\dot{\phi}\right| + B_3\cdot\dot{\phi}^3 + ... + B_n\cdot\dot{\phi}^n$. Most often, the so-called "linear model", "quadratic model" and "cubic model" are used to represent $B_{44}(\dot{\phi})$ in Eq.(\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_general_himeno}) by truncating the series to keep only linear, quadratic and cubic terms,

where the $B_1$ and $B_2$ are recognized as the roll damping coefficients.
From roll decay tests, those coefficients are normally derived based on the logarithmic decrements of roll peaks. However, this approach is sensitive to low-frequency disturbances and noises. An alternative and more robust approach, which utilizes full time series of roll decay tests and not only the peaks, is the numerical Parameter Identification Technique (PIT) as described in IMO (2006) and also used in Bulian (2004). In this approach a numerical solution to a one degree of freedom roll equation is fitted to the roll decay time series by tuning the parameters in the roll equation.
