\subsection{Ikeda's method: from strip theory to semi-empirical formulas}
\label{se:semi-empirical methods}
Since the scale effect of the damping is mainly associated with the skin friction on ship hulls and the friction only contributes very little to a ship's total roll damping, the most reliable way to obtain a ship's roll damping coefficients is to carry out model scale experimental tests. 
While in a ship's early design stage when only limited information is available and flexible to be adjusted, such as the ship's principal dimensions and the basic hull geometry, some semi-empirical methods were also proposed to predict the roll damping (\cite{himeno_prediction_1981}). The most recognize method was developed in a series of research articles (\cite{ikeda_roll_1978}, \cite{ikeda_eddy_1978}, \cite{ikeda_roll_1979}, \cite{ikeda_components_1978}, \cite{ikeda_velocity_1979}), and it is well-known to be named as Ikeda's method. This method divides the roll damping into five damping components, i.e., the friction component $B_F$, the eddy component $B_e$, the lift component $B_L$, the wave component $B_W$ and the bilge keel component $B_BK$, as in the following Eq.(\ref{eq:ikeda}), 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ikeda}
B = B_F + B_E + B_L + B_W + B_{BK}
\end{equation}

where the wave and eddy components require strip method calculations to get the ship's shape coefficients. This is not an attractive option for the present study since that would require calculations with exact hull geometries to be carried out for all of the ships in the study. There exist however a \emph{Simplified Ikeda method} \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} that is instead used in this study to calculate the eddy component $B_E$ and wave component $B_W$. Figure \ref{fig:ikeda_vs_simplified} shows a comparison between roll damping components calculated with \emph{Ikeda} and \emph{Simplified Ikeda method}. The roll damping is under-predicted with the simplified method for this particular case which is expected according to the limitations of this method  \cite{kawahara_simple_2011}.



The roll damping consists of linear and nonlinear components. At zero speed the nonlinear damping is caused by the two-dimensional separation at the bilge keel or near the bilge circle (Eddy damping $B_E$). While at speed the nonlinear damping is mainly caused by the hydrodynamic lift force on the hull, represented as lift damping $B_L$. $B_E$ vanishes at high speed ($F_n>0.15)$ \cite{ikeda_components_1978}.

The wave damping also changes at speed. Ikeda \cite{ikeda_components_1978} proposes a formula for the fraction between wave damping at speed and zero speed: $\frac{B_W}{B_{W0}}$

The Ikeda method has been used to calculate the roll damping for a PCTC vessel Faust \cite{soder_assessment_2019}.

The Simplified Ikeda method \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} has been implemented \cite{alexandersson_martinlarsalbertrolldecay-estimators_2020} with the intention to be used both as a benchmark and maybe also as a sub-component of a new method. The examples from \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} was recalculated to check that the method has been implemented correctly. The authors have been unable to find other ways to validate the implementation, which introduces some uncertainty to the comparisons. The method has been implemented as a function where the total roll damping and its component is calcultated: 
\input{equations/simplified_ikeda_equation}

A quadratic roll damping model can be linearized using the equivalent linear damping coefficient \cite{himeno_prediction_1981}:
\input{equations/B_e_equation}
In order to obtain the damping coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in the quadratic model in equation \ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_quadratic} roll damping is calculated for two or more roll amplitudes ($\phi_a$). $B_1$ and $B_2$ is obtained by fitting equation \ref{eq:B_e_equation} to this data as shown in figure \ref{fig:ikeda_B_1_B2}.  

A parameter variation was conducted in order to study the simplified method.
A "median ship" with the most usual parameters in the database was chosen as the baseline of the variation. The parameters were varied to the extreme values of the database, see figure \ref{fig:ship_parameters} for more details. 

Figure \ref{fig:ikeda_variation} shows this variation where all parameters have been none dimensionalized using froude scaling with $L_{pp}$ as scale factor. 
It seems that length to beam ratio between 0.23 and 0.24 has a huge peak. Also length to draft ratio below 0.034 has a large peak.
