\subsection{Examples of damping estimation from tests}
\label{examples_damping_reference_fromdatabase}
In this section, we will present a few examples of model tests, and how the linear regression and nonlinear regression to give the accurate value of $B_e$, in comparison with the time series of motion response.

Note that: in \ref{se:Existing semi-empirical methods}, we only present the method to estimate the parameters, but no examples. Here we would like to prepare for some examples to confirm the way we are presented in \ref{se:Existing semi-empirical methods} is good enough to be acted as reference to regressed the improve Ikeda\'s method for semi-empirical damping ratio analysis.
