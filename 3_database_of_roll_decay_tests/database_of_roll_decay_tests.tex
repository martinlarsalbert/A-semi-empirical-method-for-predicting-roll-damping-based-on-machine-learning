\section{Accuracy of current methods for predicting roll damping}
\label{se:accuracy_SI_method}
It was shown by \parencite{kawahara_simple_2011} that Ikeda's method does not work for some modern ships with buttock flow sterns. \parencite{soder_assessment_2019} also showed that Ikeda's method was not capable of accurately predicting the roll damping for a Pure Car and Truck Carrier. The SI-method being a simplified version of Ikeda's method most likely inherits its problems but also introduces some extrapolation errors as reported by \parencite{rudakovic_application_2017}. In the following, 227 existing roll decay model tests conducted at SSPA Maritime Dynamics Laboratory are used to validate the SI-method. The comparison will help identify the drawbacks and improvement potentials of the SI-method. It aims at further developing this method to increase its accuracy through some statistical regression analysis based on the large test database.
