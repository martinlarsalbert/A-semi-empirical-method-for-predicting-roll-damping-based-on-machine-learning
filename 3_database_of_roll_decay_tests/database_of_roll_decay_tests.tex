\section{Accuracy of current methods for predicting roll damping}
\label{se:accuracy_SI_method}
The most recognized and widespreadly used method to predict a ship's roll damping is the so-called simplified Ikeda's method. Some further development of the Ikeda's methods are also existed for specific ship types. However, these methods were seldom validated for wide ship applications due to for example lack of enough test data sources. Some studies also shows the simplified Ikeda's method is not capable to accurate predict the roll damping of modern ships. In the following, 227 existing roll decay model tests conducted at SSPA Maritime Dynamics Laboratory are used to check the accuracy of the simplified Ikeda's method and its extension methods. The comparison will help to identify the drawbacks and improvement potentials of the Ikeda's method. It aims at further developing this method to increase its accuracy based on the large test database through some statistical regression analysis.
