\subsection{Overall accuracy of Simplified Ikeda method}
\label{se:overall_comparison}
An investigation of how well the implementation of the Simplified Ikeda method (see section \ref{se:semi-empirical methods}) agree with the corresponding result in the roll damping database has been carried out. 

To enable a comparison the equivalent linear damping coefficient is used \parencite{himeno_prediction_1981}:
\input{equations/B_e_equation}

For the roll damping database $B_1$ and $B_2$ can be inserted directly into equation  \ref{eq:B_e_equation}. 
In order to obtain the same coefficients for the simplified Ikeda's method, roll damping is calculated for two or more roll amplitudes $\phi_a$ for the same motion frequency (for this study, it is referred to the natural frequency $\omega_0$ because free roll decay tests were used for the model tests.). $B_1$ and $B_2$ is obtained by fitting equation \ref{eq:B_e_equation} to this data as shown in Fig.(\ref{fig:ikeda_B_1_B2}).

\end{figure}

$\hat{B_e}$ is the non-dimensional equivalent linear damping coefficient \parencite{himeno_prediction_1981}.
Figure \ref{fig:B_e_hat_ikeda_zero} and \ref{fig:B_e_hat_ikeda} show a comparison of $\hat{B_e}$ from model tests and the simplified method where predicted damping with simplified Ikeda's method has been plotted against corresponding test in the roll damping database.

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


The comparison show poor agreement, both at speed and zero speed. It was discovered that the prediction error was highly depending on the ship draught $T$ which is shown in figure  \ref{fig:B_e_hat_error}.
The figure shows that the error is much larger for $T/L_{pp}<0.034$. Also high frequencies ($\hat{\omega_0} > 0.6$) had higher errors.

    \caption{$\hat{B_e}$ comparison with $T/L_{pp}>0.034$}
    \label{fig:B_e_hat_good}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:B_e_hat_good} shows the comparison for only model tests with $T/L_{pp}>0.034$ and $\hat{\omega_0} < 0.6$.
This confirms the small draft to beam ratio limit of this method as mentioned in \parencite{kawahara_simple_2011}. The corresponding $R^2$ score is 0.38.
