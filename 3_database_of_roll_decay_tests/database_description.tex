\subsection{Data description}

227 Roll decay tests have been collected with main parameters according to figure \ref{fig:ship_parameters}. 

Only tests at even keel have been included (trim smaller than 0.4 degrees). 


and the parameters in the linear, quadratic and cubic model have been identified using the system identification techniques as described in section \ref{se:system_identification}. The $R^2$ score coefficient was calculated for each model and model test. The mean $R^2$ was 0.995 for the cubic model, 0.993 for the quadratic and 0.986 for the linear model. The quadratic model has almost the same accuracy as the cubic and is therefore chosen to be used for the rest of this project. Figure \ref{fig:roll_decay_model_compare} shows a comparison between the linear, quadratic and cubic model, where it can be seen that the linear model can not give a perfect representation for the whole range of roll angles.

Some ships have results that are very much different than the rest. The meta data of these  \emph{outliers} have first been double checked for typing errors and then removed if no error has been found. And in some cases unexpected results have been explained by extreme hull shapes or the presence of active stabilizing devises, such as active fins or stabilizing tanks.
Some ships with extreme main dimensions have also been removed, since the error they may add to the model will not gain any relevance.
