\subsection{Sensitivity analysis of the SI-method for all database ships}
\label{se:accuracy_SI_method}
Since a very large discrepancy between the model test results and the SI-method was observed for both the limited and unlimited approach, a sensitivity study of the SI-method was carried out. A so-called ``reference ship" with ship parameters located in the middle of the SI-method applicable boundaries as in Eq. (\ref{eq:SI_limits}) is used for the investigation. For the sensitive study, only the relatively important ship parameters, i.e., $C_b$,$\frac{Beam}{T}$, $\frac{\overline{OG}}{T}$, $A_0$, $\frac{BK_B}{Beam}$, $\frac{BK_L}{L_{pp}}$, are chosen to investigate the effects of their variation on different roll damping components.

The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:SI_sensitivity}. It can be seen that the wave damping component $B_W$ increases a lot with the absolute value of $\overline{OG}/T$. It can be also seen that the wave damping has an enormous increase when the beam to draught ratio exceeds the input boundary, which seems to be the case for at least one third of the roll decay tests. It can also be noted that most of the ships in the database have midsection coefficients $A_0$ and bilge keel heights outside the limits. The unrealistic prediction of wave damping component $B_W$ in terms of $\frac{Beam}{T}$ and $\frac{\overline{OG}}{T}$ should be further examined. The big variation might be caused by the improper ship parameter $\frac{Beam}{T}$ that is outside the boundaries used in the SI-method. In the following the SI-method is further examined by comparing it to corresponding results with the original Ikeda's method.
