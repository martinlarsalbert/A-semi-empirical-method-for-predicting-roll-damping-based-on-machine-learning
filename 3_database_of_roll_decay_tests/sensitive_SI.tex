\subsection{Sensitivity analysis of the SI-method for all database ships}
\label{se:accuracy_SI_method}
Since a very large discrepancy between the model test results and the SI-method outside its limits was observed, a sensitivity study was carried out. A so-called ``reference ship`` with ship parameters located in the middle of the SI-method applicable boundaries as in Eq. (\ref{eq:SI_limits}) is used for the investigation. For the sensitive study, only the relatively important ship parameters, i.e., $C_b$,$\frac{Beam}{T}$, $\frac{\overline{OG}}{T}$, $A_0$, $\frac{BK_B}{Beam}$, $\frac{BK_L}{L_{pp}}$, are chosen to investigate the effects of their variation on different roll damping components. The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:SI_sensitivity}. It can be seen that the wave damping component $B_W$ increases a lot with the absolute value of $\overline{OG}/T$. It can be also seen that the wave damping has an enormous increase when the beam to draught ratio exceeds the input boundary, which seems to be the case for at least one third of the roll decay tests. It can also be noted that most of the ships in the database have midsection coefficients $A_0$ and bilge keel heights outside the limits. The unrealistic prediction of wave damping component $B_W$ in terms of $\frac{Beam}{T}$ and $\frac{\overline{OG}}{T}$ should be further examined. If this is is originating from the original Ikeda's method or being an extrapolation error from the polynomials within SI-method will be examined in the next section.
