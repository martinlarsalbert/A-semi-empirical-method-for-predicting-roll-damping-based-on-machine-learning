\section{Conclusions}
\label{se:conclusions}

The roll damping derived from roll decay model tests has been compared with calculations with the implementation of the Simplified Ikeda method with poor agreement, especially for small draft to beam ratios which can be encountered at Ballast loading condition for many modern ships.

A regression model has been developed with a little bit better agreement, but still with quite much errors. It seems that more advanced methods, original Ikeda method with strip calculations, CFD or model testing, to predict roll damping is still a better option to get reliable predictions.
