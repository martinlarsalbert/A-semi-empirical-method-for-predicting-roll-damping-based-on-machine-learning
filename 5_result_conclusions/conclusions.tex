\section{Conclusions}
\label{se:conclusions}

The roll damping database has been compared with predictions with the implementation of the Simplified Ikeda method. The database and the predictions show agreement for some cases (see figure \ref{fig:B_e_hat_good}) but poor agreement for other cases, especially for small draft to beam ratios, typically for Ballast loading condition for many modern ships. It seems that exceeding the limits of the the Simplified Ikeda method will give poor results. These limits are unfortunately not so well defined in \cite{kawahara_simple_2011}. The comparison in the present paper suggest a lower limit of the draught to length ratio of $T/L_{pp}>0.034$.



A regression model has been developed with a little bit better agreement, but still with quite much errors. It seems that more advanced methods, original Ikeda method with strip calculations, CFD or model testing, to predict roll damping is still a better option to get reliable predictions.
