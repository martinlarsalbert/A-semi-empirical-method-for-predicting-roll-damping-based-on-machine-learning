\section{Results}
\label{se:results}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A roll decay database with 400 roll decay tests has been created.
  \item A roll damping database has been build with roll damping coefficients from system identification of roll decay tests.
  \item A classification of the roll damping results has been conducted.
  \item The accuracy of Ikedas simplified method has been investigated by benchmark with roll damping database.
  \item A new method has been proposed, based on regression of the roll damping database, as an improvement to the simplified Ikeda method.
\end{itemize}
