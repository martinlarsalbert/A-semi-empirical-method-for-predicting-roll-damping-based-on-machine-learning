\section*{Abstract}\label{se:abstract}

Semi-empirical methods such as the Ikeda’s method is widely used to predict roll damping for practical purposes. Recent work has shown that the applicability and accuracy of Ikeda’s method for modern hull forms are somewhat uncertain which is very unfortunate, especially for analysis of parametric roll. 
%A small error in the roll damping prediction can make the difference between having no parametric roll and disaster.
This paper presents a new semi-empirical method as a complement to the simplified Ikeda's method. The new method has been developed using a regression based approach on a roll damping database built by performing parameter identification of roll decay model tests. 
The new method is estimated to have higher accuracy than the simplified Ikeda's method which has been investigated using cross validation on the roll damping database. The paper also suggests a lower limit for the ship draughts where the simplified Ikeda's method can be used.
