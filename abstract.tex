\section*{Abstract}\label{se:abstract}
Semi-empirical methods such as the Ikeda’s method or simplified Ikeda’s method are widely used to predict roll damping for practical purposes. Recent work has shown that the applicability and accuracy of Ikeda’s method for modern hull forms are somewhat uncertain, especially for analysis of parametric roll. 
This paper investigates the accuracy of the simplified Ikeda's method for roll damping coefficients of modern ships, by comparison with a large number of roll decay model tests, and the strip theory analysis based Ikeda's method. Possible ways to improve the accuracy of semi-empirical predictions of roll damping for modern ships is also proposed in this paper.
