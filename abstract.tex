\section*{Abstract}\label{se:abstract}
Having an accurate prediction of ship roll damping is crucial when analyzing roll motions. In this paper the well known simplified Ikeda's method (here SI-method) is investigated. The method is compared with a very large database of roll decay tests and a smaller set of predictions with the original Ikeda's method. Most of the ships in the database (containing modern merchant ships) have dimensions outside the limits of the SI-method. The method showed very poor agreement with model tests outside its limits and acceptable agreement for the very few ships within. It was concluded that the deviations are caused by extrapolation errors of the wave damping. Two ways to improve the accuracy of SI, based on regression, gave roughly the same accuracy as using the original Ikeda's method. Further research effort should be devoted to extending the limits of the SI-method.
