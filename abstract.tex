Having an accurate prediction of ship roll damping is crucial when analyzing roll motions. In this paper, the simplified Ikeda method (SI-method) is compared with the original Ikeda method. The methods are compared using results in a database of roll decay tests carried out on modern merchant ships, and a smaller set of predictions where the original Ikeda method was used. It was found that most of the ships in the database had dimensions outside the limits of the SI-method. Thus, the SI-method showed poor agreement with model tests outside its limits but acceptable agreement for the ships within limits. It was found that the deviations were caused by extrapolation errors of the wave damping in the SI-method. Two ways to improve the accuracy of the SI-method were proposed based on regression, which gave the same accuracy as the original Ikeda method.
