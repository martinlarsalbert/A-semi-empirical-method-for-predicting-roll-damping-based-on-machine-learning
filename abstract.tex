\section*{Abstract}\label{se:abstract}
Semi-empirical methods such as the Ikeda’s method or simplified Ikeda’s method are widely used to predict roll damping for practical purposes. Recent work has shown that the applicability and accuracy of Ikeda’s method for modern hull forms are somewhat uncertain which is very unfortunate, especially for analysis of parametric roll. 
This paper investigates the accuracy of the simplified Ikeda's method for modern ships, by comparison with roll damping coefficients obtained from a large number of roll decay model tests. Possible ways to improve the accuracy of semi-empirical predictions of roll damping for modern ships is also investigated in this paper.
