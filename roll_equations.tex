The roll motion can be written as \cite{himeno_prediction_1981}:
\input{equations/roll_equation_himeno}
The equation expresses the roll moment [Nm] along a longitudinal axis though the centre of gravity.
Where $A_{44}$ is the virtual mass moment of intertia, $B_{44}$ is the roll damping moment and $C_{44}$ is the restoring moment. $M_{44}$ represents the external moment (usually moment from external waves).
The roll damping moment $B_{44}$ is the primary interest in this paper. The $B_{44}$ is determined using model scale roll decay tests. $B_{44}$ is determined using system identification, by finding the best fit to the following equation:
\input{equations/roll_decay_equation_general_himeno}
The external moment is zero during a roll decay test, since there are no external forces present.
The $B_{44}$ can be expressed as a series expansion:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dampingSeriesExansion}
B_{44} = B_1\cdot\dot{\phi} + B_2\cdot\dot{\phi}\left|\dot{\phi}\right| + B_3\cdot\dot{\phi}^3 + ...$
\end{equation}
Truncating this series at the quadratic term gives a "quadratic damping model":

Assuming quadratic damping the roll decay equation is written:
\input{equations/roll_decay_equation_himeno_quadratic}
The restoring moment can be expressed using the $GZ$ curve:
\input{equations/restoring_equation}
where $m$ is the mass of the ship
It is common that the restoring moment is linearized using the meta centric height $GM$:
\input{equations/restoring_equation_linear}
Introducing a helper coefficient $C$: 
\input{equations/C_equation}
In the case of linearized restoring moment $C$ can be written as:
\input{equations/C_equation_linear}
\input{equations/roll_decay_equation_himeno_quadratic_c}
It is common to rewrite the roll decay equation by dividing with $A_{44}$ and conducting the following substitutions:
\input{equations/zeta_equation}
\input{equations/d_equation}
\input{equations/omega0_equation}
Commonly used quadratic roll decay equation:
\input{equations/roll_decay_equation_quadratic}
And linear roll decay equation is obtained when $d=0$
