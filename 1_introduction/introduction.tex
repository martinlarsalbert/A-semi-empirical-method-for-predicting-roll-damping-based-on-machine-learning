\section{Introduction}
\label{se:introduction}

In the second generation of intact stability criteria, the IMO addressed the importance of ships having sufficient roll damping to avoid large roll motions and parametric rolling, as well as excessive acceleration \parencite{imo_finalization_2016}.
The design of modern ships especially volume carriers seems to be more vulnerable to these phenomena, which gained more attention since the late 90â€™s due to some accidents such as the APL China casualty.
\parencite{soder_ikeda_2019} showed that a relatively small difference in the roll damping prediction can lead to the difference between sever roll angles and hardly noticeable motions. Therefore, it is crucial to develop method for a good prediction of roll damping for safe ship design.
Since the scale effect of the damping is mainly associated with the skin friction on ship hulls and the friction only contributes very little to a full-scale ship's total roll damping, experimental model tests are a widely accepted method to estimate a ship's roll damping \parencite{imo_1200_2006}. A lot of research activities have been put on methods to estimate roll damping from experimental model tests. For example, \parencite[]{hua_approximation_2011} investigated a second order oscillator model to approximate the a ship's roll damping based on both experiments at different scales and numerical calculations.
As the rapid increase of computation capability, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods have also been used to calculate the roll damping as in \parencite{kristiansen_experimental_2014} and \parencite{henry_peter_piehl_ship_2016}.  

However, in the early stage of ship design, when only limited information is available, such as the ship's principal dimensions and the basic hull geometry, both CFD methods and experimental model tests are not feasible options. Therefore, simpler methods are widely used. 
%Simple strip theory methods can give quite accurate prediction of a ship's pitch, heave, sway and yaw motions, but often overestimates the roll motions because of significant viscous effects on the roll damping \parencite{kawahara_simple_2011}. Therefore other methods are used to obtain the roll damping at early design stage. 
Several semi-empirical methods were proposed in the late 70s \parencite{himeno_prediction_1981}. The most recognize method was developed in a series of research articles \parencite{ikeda_roll_1978,ikeda_eddy_1978,ikeda_roll_1979,ikeda_components_1978,ikeda_velocity_1979}, often referred to as the Ikeda's method based on strip theory based analysis. This method divides the roll damping into five damping components, i.e., the friction component, the eddy component, the lift component, the wave component and the bilge keel component. This semi-empirical method is also recommended by \parencite{ittc_ittc_2011}. As reported by  \parencite{kawahara_simple_2011} and \parencite{soder_ikeda_2019}, Ikeda's method may not work well for unconventional ships, such as container ship and PCTC with pronounced flare bow and stern structures. 
There also exist a simplified version of the Ikeda's method (named as SI-method here) \parencite{kawahara_simple_2011} as a regression on calculation results from the Ikeda's method for a series of parameterized hull shapes, but it has not been widely validated by actual model tests. 

The main objective of this paper is to investigate the accuracy of the SI-method for modern ships using more than 250 roll decay tests conducted at SSPA during the past 15 years. Furthermore, possible ways to improve the accuracy of the SI-method for modern ships will be investigated.
To make the completeness of the paper, Section \ref{se:methods_for_prediction_and_analysis} presents the basic governing equations of roll motions and how roll damping can be obtained from roll decay tests and the SI-method. 
Based on the roll decay test database, different methods to estimate roll damping are compared in Section \ref{se:accuracy_SI_method}. Section \ref{se:correction_SI_method} proposes two new regression-based methods to improve the accuracy of roll damping in comparison with the SI-method. Conclusions are given in section \ref{se:conclusions}.
