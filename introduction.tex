\section{Introduction}
\label{se:introduction}
%If an undamaged ship capsizes, it will most likely do so by reaching a critical roll angle, for obvious geometrical reasons. Ship stability in roll %has therefore a lot of attention when designing ships. When also considering the dynamics of ships, the damping of the roll motion will also be very %important, in order to avoid large motions when near the resonance frequency. Verifying that a ship has sufficient roll damping is therefore a %critical part of all ship designs.

\subsection{Thesis statement}
A large set of relatively new empirical data of model roll decay tests is used to investigate the accuracy of Ikedas simplified method. The data is also used to create a new semi empirical method to predict ship roll damping.

\subsection{Purpose of research paper}
Many crucial decisions that are made during the early design stage of ships, are based on predictions where the roll damping has been calculated with semi-empirical methods. The accuracy of these methods, when applied to modern ship designs, is however quite uncertain. Söder et al. \cite{soder_ikeda_2019} has for instance investigated Ikeda’s method for modern volume carriers where it was concluded that the speed dependence of the bilge keels damping was underestimated.


%\subsection{Research Area}
%IMO has in the second generation intact stability criteria \cite{imo_second_nodate} addressed six possible dynamic stability failures. Having %sufficient roll damping is very important in these failure modes, especially in the modes: \emph{Parametric roll}, \emph{Dead Ship condition} and %\emph{Excessive acceleration}. Semi-empirical formulas to predict roll damping are examined in this project using \emph{Machine Learning} (ML) %techniques. Historical data from roll decay scale model tests is used to examine the accuracy of existing semi-empirical methods to make better %predictions of roll damping for future ships.


%\subsection{Methods}
%The accuracy of state of the art semi-empirical roll damping methods are investigated by benchmarks of a large number \textcolor{red}{(how many?)} of %roll decay model tests. Machine Learning techniques are used to investigate if the best semi-empirical methods can be improved. The methodology used %in this project is general, so that it can, with some effort, be reused to other aspects of ship dynamics such as: seakeeping and manoeuvring.
