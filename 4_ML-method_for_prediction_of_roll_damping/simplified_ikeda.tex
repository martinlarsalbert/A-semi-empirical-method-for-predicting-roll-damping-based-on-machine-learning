\section{Simplified Ikeda method}
\label{se:simplified_ikeda}
The \emph{Simplified Ikeda method} \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} has been implemented with the intention to be used both as a benchmark and maybe also as a sub-component of a new method. The examples from \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} was recalculated to check that the method has been implemented correctly.
The method has been implemented as a function where the total roll damping and its component is calcultated:
