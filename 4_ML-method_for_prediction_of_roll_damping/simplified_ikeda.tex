\section{Simplified Ikeda method}
\label{se:simplified_ikeda}
The \emph{Simplified Ikeda method} \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} has been implemented with the intention to be used both as a benchmark and maybe also as a sub-component of a new method. The examples from \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} was recalculated to check that the method has been implemented correctly.

Both  \emph{Simplified Ikeda method} can
