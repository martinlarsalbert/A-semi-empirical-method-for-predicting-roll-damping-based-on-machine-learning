\section{Simplified Ikeda method}
\label{se:simplified_ikeda}
The \emph{Simplified Ikeda method} \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} has been implemented with the intention to be used both as a benchmark and maybe also as a sub-component of a new method. The examples from \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} was recalculated to check that the method has been implemented correctly.
The method has been implemented as a function where the total roll damping and its component is calcultated: 
\input{equations/simplified_ikeda_equation}

A quadratic roll damping model can be linearized using the equivalent linear damping coefficient \cite{himeno_prediction_1981}:
\input{equations/B_e_equation}
In order to obtain the damping coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in the quadratic model in equation \ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_quadratic} roll damping is calculated for two or more roll amplitudes ($\phi_a$). $B_1$ and $B_2$ is obtained by fitting equation \ref{eq:B_e_equation} to this data as shown in figure \ref{fig:ikeda_B_1_B2}.
