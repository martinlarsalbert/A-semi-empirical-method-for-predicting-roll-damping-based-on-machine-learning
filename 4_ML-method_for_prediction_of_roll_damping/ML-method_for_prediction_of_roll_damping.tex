\section{ML-method for prediction of roll damping}
\label{se:regression} 

Only tests at even keel have been included (trim smaller than 0.4 degrees). 

\subsection{Missing data}

\subsection{Outliers}
Some ships have results that are very much different than the rest. The meta data of these  \emph{outliers} have first been double checked for typing errors and then removed if no error has been found. And in some cases unexpected results have been explained by extreme hull shapes or the presence of active stabilizing devises, such as active fins or stabilizing tanks.
Some ships with extreme main dimensions have also been removed, since the error they may add to the model will not gain any relevance.
