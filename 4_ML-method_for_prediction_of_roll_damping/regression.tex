Work has been conducted to propose a correction to the SI-method based on the findings in this paper. The idea is to find correction factors that can be applied to the roll damping components calculated with the SI-method. In order to handle the problem of $\hat{B_e}$ accuracy being very much depending on the roll amplitude a roll amplitude correction factor has also added. The correction factors have been determined by fitting a linear regression model to the roll damping components, calculated with the SI-method at roll amplitudes between 0 and 10 degrees, giving the following expression: 
\input{equations/polynom_correction}
The accuracy of the SI-method is significantly improved by applying these corrections, which can be seen when comparing figure \ref{fig:ikeda_components} with figure \ref{fig:ikeda_phi_a}.

\subsection{Cross validation}

When constructing a regression model from a data set, over-fitting the data can be a problem. Including too many parameters and/or allowing too high order of the model would give a very good representation of the present roll damping data, but large extrapolation errors when the model is used on other data. Cross validation has been used to "mimic" this situation, where the model should make predictions on "new data", for ships that have not been part of the regression (the training of the model). The model that can make the best prediction on "new data" is considered as the best. The best model has been developed by optimizing the selection of parameters (the features). The regression model was allowed to have features selected from a "gross list" of all available meta data. The linear regression should determine coefficients in a mathematical expression represented as a polynomial up to second order and including coupling terms. The model with a selection of terms that gives the highest score in the cross validation is considered as the best.
