	abstract = {The nonlinear responses of ship rolling motion characterized by a roll damping moment are of great interest to naval architects and ocean engineers. Modeling and identification of the nonlinear damping moment are essential to incorporate the inherent nonlinearity in design, analysis, and control of a ship. A stochastic nonparametric approach for identification of nonlinear damping in the general mechanical system has been presented in the literature (Han and Kinoshits 2012). The method has been also applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship at zero-forward speed (Han and Kinoshits 2013). In the presence of forward speed, however, the characteristic of roll damping moment of a ship is significantly changed due to the lift effect. In this paper, the stochastic inverse method is applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship moving at nonzero-forward speed. The workability and validity of the method are verified with laboratory tests under controlled conditions. In experimental trials, two different types of ship rolling motion are considered: time-dependent transient motion and frequency-dependent periodic motion. It is shown that this method enables the inherent nonlinearity in damping moment to be estimated, including its reliability analysis.},

Notes about content:

Roll motion as a dynamic system
Good explanation of what roll damping is and why it is important.
Introduction contain description of chapters and content.
Another approach is to use existing Ansatz equations for the damping coefficients and derive a roll damping method by fitting the the model to experimental or simulated results.
To reduce the number of unknown coefficients often a strip or panel method is used to compute the added mass and restoring forces prior to the regression analysis
For higher order damping terms more complex solution methods need to be applied (Laplace and Fourier transformation or perturbation methods?
Eq 2.23 for damping! B=phi1d + phi*phi1d + {\textbar}phi1d{\textbar}*phi1d
Eq 3.15 zeta=zeta0*omega0 [1/s]
"The resulting coefficients of both methods deviate up to 10\% from each other"
"If the roll amplitudes fall under a threshold of 1◦the time series is truncated,because at a roll motion near its extinction the roll period tends to drift away"
Forced motion vs. forced moment vs. roll decay.

Therefore experimental results or some prediction methods are used to get the roll damping in design stage of ships. Among some prediction methods, Ikeda’s one is widely used in many ship motion computer programs. Using the method, the roll damping of various ship hulls with various bilge keels are calculated to investigate its characteristics. Ship hull forms are systematically changed by changing length, beam, draft, midship sectional coefficient and prismatic coefficient. On the basis of these predicted roll damping of various ships, a very simple prediction formula of the roll damping of ships is deduced. It is found, however, that this formula cannot be used for ships that have higher position of the center of gravity.},

Forced roll and free decay experiments were carried out at MARINTEK in a joint project between VARD, DNV GL and MARINTEK during Nov. 2012. The 1:25 ship model was tested both with and without bilge keels. 19 forced roll periods were tested at 4 roll angles (2, 4, 6 and 10deg). Free decay tests were performed for initial roll angles 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15deg. Damping was extracted and compared with numerical simulations from a potential flow strip theory program (VERES) and a commercial CFD tool (StarCCM+). Both qualitative and quantitative agreement between the experimentally and numerically obtained damping parameters was documented. Discrepancies were identified and discussed. The three different methods of investigation gave together a basis for discussing the effect of bilge keels. From the present study, it is recommended that both experimental and numerical work in combination, for both forced roll and free decay tests, should be performed to assess the damping efficiency of bilge keels.

For volume carriers the hull lift and bilge keel components are the dominating components and the estimation of these components in the original method are benchmarked and scrutinized. It is concluded that the speed dependence of the bilge keels damping is underestimated by the original method. This is partially explained by that Ikeda seems to have underestimated the lift force of the bilge keels in his analytical expressions. Correcting for this and taking account of the lift force-generated pressure on the hull surface gives overall better agreement with model tests. It is also concluded that the hull lift damping component is significantly overestimated with the original method. Non-viscid CFD is used to propose a new generic expression for estimating the lift coefficients for volume carriers which greatly improve the accuracy in comparison to model test results. With these improvements Ikeda’s method is revitalized and the applicability is extended to unconventional volume carriers.},
