	abstract = {The nonlinear responses of ship rolling motion characterized by a roll damping moment are of great interest to naval architects and ocean engineers. Modeling and identification of the nonlinear damping moment are essential to incorporate the inherent nonlinearity in design, analysis, and control of a ship. A stochastic nonparametric approach for identification of nonlinear damping in the general mechanical system has been presented in the literature (Han and Kinoshits 2012). The method has been also applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship at zero-forward speed (Han and Kinoshits 2013). In the presence of forward speed, however, the characteristic of roll damping moment of a ship is significantly changed due to the lift effect. In this paper, the stochastic inverse method is applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship moving at nonzero-forward speed. The workability and validity of the method are verified with laboratory tests under controlled conditions. In experimental trials, two different types of ship rolling motion are considered: time-dependent transient motion and frequency-dependent periodic motion. It is shown that this method enables the inherent nonlinearity in damping moment to be estimated, including its reliability analysis.},

Notes about content:

Roll motion as a dynamic system
Good explanation of what roll damping is and why it is important.
Introduction contain description of chapters and content.
Another approach is to use existing Ansatz equations for the damping coefficients and derive a roll damping method by fitting the the model to experimental or simulated results.
To reduce the number of unknown coefficients often a strip or panel method is used to compute the added mass and restoring forces prior to the regression analysis
For higher order damping terms more complex solution methods need to be applied (Laplace and Fourier transformation or perturbation methods?
Eq 2.23 for damping! B=phi1d + phi*phi1d + {\textbar}phi1d{\textbar}*phi1d
Eq 3.15 zeta=zeta0*omega0 [1/s]
"The resulting coefficients of both methods deviate up to 10\% from each other"
"If the roll amplitudes fall under a threshold of 1◦the time series is truncated,because at a roll motion near its extinction the roll period tends to drift away"

Therefore experimental results or some prediction methods are used to get the roll damping in design stage of ships. Among some prediction methods, Ikeda’s one is widely used in many ship motion computer programs. Using the method, the roll damping of various ship hulls with various bilge keels are calculated to investigate its characteristics. Ship hull forms are systematically changed by changing length, beam, draft, midship sectional coefficient and prismatic coefficient. On the basis of these predicted roll damping of various ships, a very simple prediction formula of the roll damping of ships is deduced. It is found, however, that this formula cannot be used for ships that have higher position of the center of gravity.},

Forced roll and free decay experiments were carried out at MARINTEK in a joint project between VARD, DNV GL and MARINTEK during Nov. 2012. The 1:25 ship model was tested both with and without bilge keels. 19 forced roll periods were tested at 4 roll angles (2, 4, 6 and 10deg). Free decay tests were performed for initial roll angles 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15deg. Damping was extracted and compared with numerical simulations from a potential flow strip theory program (VERES) and a commercial CFD tool (StarCCM+). Both qualitative and quantitative agreement between the experimentally and numerically obtained damping parameters was documented. Discrepancies were identified and discussed. The three different methods of investigation gave together a basis for discussing the effect of bilge keels. From the present study, it is recommended that both experimental and numerical work in combination, for both forced roll and free decay tests, should be performed to assess the damping efficiency of bilge keels.

For volume carriers the hull lift and bilge keel components are the dominating components and the estimation of these components in the original method are benchmarked and scrutinized. It is concluded that the speed dependence of the bilge keels damping is underestimated by the original method. This is partially explained by that Ikeda seems to have underestimated the lift force of the bilge keels in his analytical expressions. Correcting for this and taking account of the lift force-generated pressure on the hull surface gives overall better agreement with model tests. It is also concluded that the hull lift damping component is significantly overestimated with the original method. Non-viscid CFD is used to propose a new generic expression for estimating the lift coefficients for volume carriers which greatly improve the accuracy in comparison to model test results. With these improvements Ikeda’s method is revitalized and the applicability is extended to unconventional volume carriers.},

	doi = {10.1243/1475090041737958},
	abstract = {In this work a combined analytical-numerical approach is proposed to address the problem of the ship roll motion under the combined action of wind and waves. Roll motion is modelled as a one-degree-of-freedom system non-linear in both damping and restoring. The approach is modular, allowing an easy update of the methodology on the basis of new research outcomes. Realistic environmental conditions regarding the effects of both wind and waves are taken into account and can be easily changed. The spatial correlation of wind gusts is taken into account by means of an 'aerodynamic admittance' function, whereas the moment due to waves is obtained from the sea slope spectrum using the concept of effective wave slope, leading to a 'hydrodynamic admittance' function. Both static and dynamic aspects of the problems are taken into account. The proposed analytical procedure, based on statistical linearization technique, allows approximate statistical averages of the roll motion, assumed to be Gaussian, to be obtained without necessarily resorting to time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. On the basis of the results obtained, an estimation of the capsize probability can be carried out. It seems that the effect of wind gustiness could be considered very small when compared with the effects of waves and mean wind speed when the metacentric height is sufficiently large. Finally, the presented approach moves towards the concept of 'performance-based analysis', recently introduced at the International Maritime Organization as the basis for future developments of intact stability, in a clear and formal way.},

	abstract = {Proper estimation of roll damping moment is of paramount importance for adequate assessment of dynamic stability of ships. However, experimental data on roll damping of inland vessels are scarce and unreliable. Thus the applicability of classic Ikeda’s method and its simplified version on typical European inland vessels is investigated, with specific focus on eddy making component. It is found that the simplified Ikeda’s method, in comparison to the classic method, may considerably underestimate the eddy making component of damping of full hull forms, or even return negative values, although the block coefficient is within the limits of method applicability. Hence, the paper explores possibilities of adjusting the simplified Ikeda’s method in order to improve the observed shortcoming, as well as to extend its application to stability analysis of inland ships.},

	abstract = {Accurate calculation of the roll damping moment at resonance condition is essential for roll motion prediction. Because at the resonance condition, the moment of inertia counteracts restoring moment and only the damping moment resists increase in the roll angle. There are various methods to calculate the roll damping moment which are based on potential ﬂow theory. These methods have limitations to taking into account the viscous effects in estimating the roll motion, while, CFD as a numerical method is capable of considering the viscous effects. In this study, a CFD method based on a harmonic excited roll motion (HERM) technique is used to compute the roll motion and the roll damping moment of a containership’s model in different conditions. The inﬂuence of excitation frequency, forward speed and degrees of freedom at beam-sea and oblique-sea realizations are considered in estimating the roll damping coefﬁcients. The results are validated against model tests, where a good agreement is found.},

	abstract = {Of all the six degrees of freedom, the roll motion of a ship is the most poorly understood and displays complicated phenomena. Due to the low potential wave damping at the natural frequency, the effective analysis of ship roll dynamics comes down to the accurate estimation of the viscous roll damping. This paper provides overview of the importance of roll damping and an extensive literature review of the various viscous roll damping prediction methods applied by researchers over the years. The paper also discusses in detail the current state of the art estimation of viscous roll damping for ship shaped structures. A computer code is developed based on this method and its results are compared with experimental data to demonstrate the accuracy of the method. While some of the key references describing this method are not available in English, some others have been found to contain typographic errors. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive summary of the state of the art method in one place for future reference.},

A method based on the 3-D CFD approach for calculating the roll damping of a ship is proposed in this paper. The free decay experiments of 4 different types of ships at zero velocity are carried out. The roll damping coefficients are calculated and compared with the experiment results, with a good agreement. It is shown that the method adopted in this paper could be used to simulate the free rolling of a ship in the calm water at zero velocity very well and with good, stable accuracy for the prediction of the roll damping, and also with good applicability. This method may be further developed for the prediction of a full scale ship in the future.},
